# LiveSplit.PkmnRed++
This is a [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.github.io) [ASL](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit/blob/master/Documentation/Auto-Splitters.md) script for **Pok√©mon Ruby/Sapphire** on emulator.

### Supported emulators:
- [GSR](https://github.com/CasualPokePlayer/gsr/)
- [mGBA](https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba)
    - **Note:** Your emulator must be named `GSR.exe` or `mGBA.exe` order for the splitter to work.

## Features
- Automatically start the timer when you start a new game
- Automatically split for certain events (chosen in the settings)
- Automatically restarts the timer when changing options before starting new game

## Installation
- Go to "Edit Splits..." in LiveSplit
- Enter the name of the game in "Game Name"
    - This must be entered correctly for LiveSplit to know which script to load
- Click the "Activate" button to download and enable the autosplitter script
    - If you ever want to stop using the autosplitter altogether, just click "Deactivate"

## Set-up
- Go to "Edit Splits..." in LiveSplit
- Click "Settings" to configure the autosplitter
    - **Note:** If for some reason LiveSplit does not automatically load the script, click "Browse...", navigate to "\LiveSplit\Components\\" and select the appropriate script.

Here you can enable/disable the options for auto start, auto reset, and auto splitting. If auto splitting is enabled, then you can select the events for which you want the autosplitter to split below under "Advanced".
