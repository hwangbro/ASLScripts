# LiveSplit.Gold
This is a [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.github.io) [ASL](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit/blob/master/Documentation/Auto-Splitters.md) script for **Pok√©mon Gold Version** on emulator.

### Supported emulators:
- Gambatte-Speedrun r600+
    - **Note:** Your emulator must be named "gambatte_speedrun.exe" or "gambatte.exe" in order for the splitter to work.

## Features
- Automatically split for certain events (chosen in the settings)
- Currently does **not** automatically start timer. Due to the nature of Gen 2 LID manips, I couldn't think of a feasible way to tell if the game start was for an attempt, or for an LID manip.

## Installation
- Go to "Edit Splits..." in LiveSplit
- Enter the name of the game in "Game Name"
    - This must be entered correctly for LiveSplit to know which script to load
- Click the "Activate" button to download and enable the autosplitter script
    - If you ever want to stop using the autosplitter altogether, just click "Deactivate"

## Set-up
- Go to "Edit Splits..." in LiveSplit
- Click "Settings" to configure the autosplitter
    - **Note:** If for some reason LiveSplit does not automatically load the script, click "Browse...", navigate to "\LiveSplit\Components\\" and select the appropriate script.

Here you can enable/disable the options for auto start, auto reset, and auto splitting. If auto splitting is enabled, then you can select the events for which you want the autosplitter to split below under "Advanced".
